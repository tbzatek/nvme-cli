# Boot from NVMe over TCP (NBFT)
#
# For NVMe/TCP connections that provide namespaces containing rootfs
# it is crucial to react on carrier events and reconnect any missing
# NVMe/TCP connections as defined in the ACPI NBFT table. A custom
# /usr/lib/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-nvme-nbft-connect.sh hook
# will respawn nvmf-connect-nbft.service on such occasion.
